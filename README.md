# PI1541 IO Adapter

This is an IO adapter board for the Raspberry Pi 3 based on the awesome [Pi1541
project](https://cbm-pi1541.firebaseapp.com/) by Steve White. It is currently
very much work in progress. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

The [Gerber files](gerber/Pi1541io-rev2.zip) for the latest revision are included.

## Revisions

### Revision 3
The third revision is still in the planning phase. Ideas currently being considered:
* I2C connector for SSD1305 OLED displays.
* Alternative power supply connector with power switch.


### Revision 2
The second revision features quite a few improvements, the most important one being optional support for the 7406 bus driver IC. For further details and instructions on how to assemble this board [see here](https://www.hackup.net/2018/06/pi1541io-revision-2/).

### Revision 1
A prototype batch of the first revision has been manufactured and [tested](https://www.hackup.net/2018/05/pi1541-io-adapter/). It is generally working but there are a few minor issues. The Gerber files for this revision are included, but I would currently recommend waiting for revision 2.
