# PI1541 IO Adapter

This is an IO adapter board for the Raspberry Pi 3 based on the awesome [Pi1541
project](https://cbm-pi1541.firebaseapp.com/) by Steve White. This is currently
very much work in progress. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

### Revision 1
A prototype batch of the first revision has been manufactured and is [being tested](https://www.hackup.net/2018/05/pi1541-io-adapter/). It is generally working but there are a few minor issues. The Gerber files for this revision are included, but I would currently recommend waiting for revision 2.
